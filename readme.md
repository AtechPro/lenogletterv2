# Lenog Letter GUI v2, The successor for the Excel Dependant LetterGUI

Gah damn betul, after full consideration, meeting with Cheok, I consider to rebuild entire thing from scratch, betul ngl

Well what new, can be hosted anywere, _someone sponser me for web hosting, asal ada cara la mau hosting üòÅ_, technically its can be run anywhere in the local network

Btw, still mau **Excel**, well its have the feature for export from web, smart kan gah damn dllm

## Full Fledged Web Development

I found out building using web is more convinient then using tkinter, malas sya mau buat calculate2 barang2 pelik like the width or length of windows

PDFviewing is also limited but if lets say that you still interested on tkinter version, consider to look the [Tkinker version](https://github.com/AtechPro/lenogletterv2/tree/Tkinkerver)
